BernieSanders,"Republicans are about to vote to let 20,000 Americans die without health insurance. Think about that."
BernieSanders,The vote to proceed on the 'health care' bill is a step toward passing the most dangerous and destructive legislation in our modern history.
BernieSanders,"John McCain is a hero, one of the most respected senators and a friend. The hopes and prayers of the nation are with him and his family."

BernieSanders,We're in Kentucky to tell Mitch McConnell: do not take health care from 22 million to give tax cuts to billionaires. https://t.co/lFy2j2md95
BernieSanders,A great nation is not judged its number of billionaires or the tax breaks they get. It's judged by how we treat the most vulnerable.
BernieSanders,"When workers in West Virginia have two or three jobs to stay alive, you don’t take away their health care to give billionaires tax breaks."
BernieSanders,West Virginia’s overdose death rate is the highest in the U.S. We need more funding to address the crisis—not nearly $800B in Medicaid cuts.
BernieSanders,What kind of country are we when anyone could think about cutting help to disabled kids in order to give tax breaks to billionaires?
BernieSanders,This legislation is fatally flawed. No small tweak here or there will undo the massive damage it will cause to West Virginia and the nation.
BernieSanders,How can you draft a bill of such enormous magnitude without one public comment from experts who are most knowledgeable about health care?
BernieSanders,@SenCapito: In America we’re not supposed to take from the most vulnerable people in order to give massive tax breaks to billionaires.
BernieSanders,"While the middle class is shrinking, we will not be part of a process which takes from those families to give even more to the very rich."

BernieSanders,"We may disagree on where to go with health care, but there should at least be open debate. Not just decisions made behind closed doors."
BernieSanders,Let's not forget that Sen. McConnell still refuses to hold one hearing on the health care bill that would throw 22 million off insurance.
BernieSanders,Remember this is the wealthiest country in history. We should not have children in poverty. We should not have people without health care.

BernieSanders,Let us be clear and this is not trying to be overly dramatic: Thousands of people will die if the Republican health care bill becomes law.
BernieSanders,Republicans' bill has nothing to do with health care. It’s an enormous transfer of wealth from working people to the richest Americans.
BernieSanders,The Affordable Care Act should be improved. But the answer is not to throw 23 million Americans off of health insurance.
BernieSanders,You're not improving health care when you defund Planned Parenthood and deny millions of women their provider of health care.

BernieSanders,Trump spare us the lies and hypocrisy. Don't tell us you're a friend of working families when you make huge cuts to life or death programs.
BernieSanders,We have shown that even in very red states strong progressives can do better than anyone imagined and we can win in any state in America.

BernieSanders,"The horrific attack in London, where I was yesterday, was another outrage committed by fanatics. My thoughts are with the people of London."
BernieSanders,With or without the support of Trump and the fossil fuel industry we must transition rapidly away from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
BernieSanders,Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement would be a horrific mistake. This extraordinary crisis calls out for international cooperation.
BernieSanders,We owe a debt of gratitude to all veterans who have defended our country and to the families of those who paid the ultimate sacrifice.

BernieSanders,"Congratulations to the people of France who today, by an overwhelming vote, rejected racism and xenophobia."
BernieSanders,Our job now is to rally millions of Americans against this disastrous Republican bill to make sure that it does not pass the Senate.
BernieSanders,The Republican “health care” bill is a disaster. It has nothing to do with health care and everything to do with tax breaks for the wealthy.

BernieSanders,Our true goal is not just stopping Republicans from destroying health care. Our goal is guaranteeing health care as a right to all people.
BernieSanders,Republicans are scrambling on their health care plan and they are embarrassed. They’re on the defensive. Keep fighting back.
BernieSanders,Republicans' health care plan—tax breaks for millionaires and raised premiums for seniors—isn’t what a civilized society is about.
BernieSanders,Trump promised “insurance for everybody.” Apparently “everybody” doesn’t include the 24 million they are taking health care away from.
BernieSanders,How does it happen that we have a president who has nothing but nice things to say about Mr. Putin? What do the Russians have on Mr. Trump?
BernieSanders,Trump’s war against truth https://t.co/tk6h57WbB0

BernieSanders,"Let us never forget that in 2008, Wall Street’s greed, recklessness and illegal behavior nearly destroyed our economy"

BernieSanders,The women of this country have the right to control their own bodies and get the health care they choose. No cuts to Planned Parenthood.

BernieSanders,The wealthy don't deserve health care more than anyone else. Everyone should be guaranteed health care regardless of their income.
BernieSanders,"I've been criticized for this point, so allow me to repeat it: health care is a human right of all people, not a privilege."
BernieSanders,Remember: the U.S. is the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people. That's what we have to do.
BernieSanders,"We spend far, far more per capita for our very dysfunctional health care system. Republicans want to make that worse."
BernieSanders,"The Republican ""substitute"" for Obamacare is not really health care legislation. Its primary purpose is to provide tax breaks to the rich."

BernieSanders,Because we have a rigged tax code that has essentially legalized tax dodging for large corporations. https://t.co/JNdu2VFovW
BernieSanders,Trump’s Muslim ban isn’t about keeping us safe. A president intent on keeping us safe wouldn't give ideological ammunition to terrorists.

BernieSanders,I am proud to stand with everyone today who is fighting for dignity on the job and the right to join a union at Nissan.
BernieSanders,We need a Justice Department that will give us the facts about Russia’s ties to the Trump campaign. Jeff Sessions should resign.

BernieSanders,"It's imperative Tom understands that the same-old, same-old isn't working and that we must bring in working and young people in a new way."
BernieSanders,I congratulate Tom Perez on his election as chairman of the Democratic National Committee and look forward to working with him.
BernieSanders,"Now is the time for the American people to demand that the Congress listens to them, and not wealthy campaign contributors or lobbyists."
BernieSanders,"I believe you are entitled to justice and to equal rights, whether you're black, Hispanic, gay or transgender. You are a human being."

BernieSanders,"We will not allow Republicans to punish the elderly, children, the sick and the poor, while they reward their billionaire friends."

BernieSanders,"This is no time for despair or giving up. This is a time for organizing, educating and fighting back."
BernieSanders,The struggle for our rights is not a one-time event. It must be fought by every generation.
BernieSanders,"Obamacare isn’t perfect. But the solution is not to throw millions off health care without a replacement plan and say, “You're on your own."""
BernieSanders,"When Trump and his friends make delusional statements about ""voter fraud,"" they are setting the stage for an increase in voter suppression."
BernieSanders,"Our job today: strengthen Obamacare and stop the repeal. Tomorrow, we must join the rest of the world and guarantee health care for all."
BernieSanders,If you're rich and powerful and commit illegal behavior you get promoted to the president's cabinet. There’s something very wrong with that.
BernieSanders,Our nation worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don’t believe that is the nation we should be living in.
BernieSanders,"It appears Mr. Trump, who attacks media that makes critical remarks about him as “fake news,” doesn't understand what democracy is about."
BernieSanders,Republicans claim to represent family values but plan to throw 20 million people off health insurance. That doesn't seem like family values.
BernieSanders,25 states and cities raised minimum wages last year. How is that possible? Because millions of people stood up to fight.
BernieSanders,"Our diversity is our strength. We must take pride in that, not let hatred divide us."
BernieSanders,I would hope that Republicans have the courage to stand up to Trump's movement to authoritarianism.
BernieSanders,Trump: Want to know what fake news is? Your denial of climate change and the lies spread by fossil fuel companies to protect their profits.

BernieSanders,"Instead of draining the swamp, Trump is filling it up with the same old Wall Street insiders, whose greed nearly destroyed our economy."
BernieSanders,Talk about cowardice. Republicans are trying to ram through Pruitt's confirmation before the American people find out what is in his emails.
BernieSanders,"We need an EPA administrator whose priority is the safety of people, not the profits of the fossil fuel industry. Pruitt is not that person."
BernieSanders,Scientists are virtually unanimous that climate change is real and caused by human activity. Mr. Pruitt refuses to recognize that.
BernieSanders,"We need a Labor Secretary who will stand up for workers, raising the minimum wage &amp  pay equity for women. Mr. Puzder was not that candidate."
BernieSanders,We need to know if President Trump's foreign policy represents the best interests of this country or the best interests of Russia.
BernieSanders,"Our job: Break up the major financial institutions, not appoint more Wall Street executives to the administration as Trump has done."
BernieSanders,"Our job is to grow the trade union movement so that workers, white collar and blue collar, can stand up and fight for their rights."
BernieSanders,"Trump old workers he would stand up for them and stand up to Wall Street. Now, the same old Wall Street insiders are running the show."
BernieSanders,What I say to the American people is: stay focused. We will fight for an economy that works for all and doesn’t just benefit the wealthy.
BernieSanders,We’ve got to bring people together around a progressive agenda. They want to raise the minimum wage and make health care a right.
BernieSanders,"Trump is a total hypocrite. He campaigned saying I'm going to take on Wall Street, and then he hires the president of Goldman Sachs."
BernieSanders,When Donald Trump attacks the  media as “fake news” what he is doing is trying to move our country in an authoritarian direction.
BernieSanders,"Our job is to stand together, vigorously oppose Trump's racist immigration policies and fight for policies that work for working families."
BernieSanders,"Whether it is in conservative parts of the country or in progressive areas, the American people are fighting back. https://t.co/xIhj3j0MbM"
BernieSanders,Trump has sent many tweets the last few months. But where's the tweet saying he’ll keep his promise to not cut Medicare and Medicaid?
BernieSanders,We need an Attorney General who’ll defend the Constitution &amp  educate the president about what it means. Jeff Sessions won't be that person.
BernieSanders,"When I read the same letter as @SenWarren, no one prevented me from speaking. Sen. McConnell owes Sen. Warren an apology. #LetLizSpeak"

BernieSanders,"In the midst of massive wealth inequality, @tedcruz doesn't just want to take away health care, he wants to give huge tax breaks to the 1%."
BernieSanders,We're having an absurd discussion for the wealthiest nation. We are talking about taking health care away from 30 million people.
BernieSanders,A Medicare-for-all system would save us hundreds of billions in health care costs a year. It’s financially smart and the moral thing to do.

BernieSanders,Tell @GOP: You aren't going to take away our health care while you reward your billionaire friends. #OurFirstStand https://t.co/7CHHd8bm4X

BernieSanders,Some politicians still refuse to recognize the reality of climate change. It's 2017. That's a disgrace.
BernieSanders,"It's simple, really: Politicians should be working for their constituents' votes, not lobbyists' money. That's not radical. It's democracy."
BernieSanders,Are we comfortable as a nation to see a huge increase in millionaires and billionaires but have more people living in poverty than ever?
BernieSanders,"After all the progress we've made on women’s rights, we can't go back to the days when women didn't have the right to control their bodies."

BernieSanders,"New tax breaks for the rich and big corporations may be popular in country clubs, but it's way out of touch with what most Americans want."
BernieSanders,"We must join every other major country &amp  guarantee health care for all, not throw millions of women off excellent health care. #StandWithPP"
BernieSanders,We should not be debating whether to take health care away from 30 million people. We should be working to make health care a right for all.
BernieSanders,.@SenateGOP How do you go forward giving a death penalty to thousands of people by taking their health care away without any solution?
BernieSanders,You don’t throw 30 millions people off health care without having a plan to provide health care to those people.
BernieSanders,We can't stay silent and watch Republicans dismantle our health care system and jeopardize the economic security of millions of Americans.
BernieSanders,"Our message to Mr. Trump is simple: We are not going backwards. You will not divide us up by race, nationality, gender or sexual orientation"
BernieSanders,"In the year 2017, we should be encouraging our people to get the best education they can, not punishing them with a mountain of debt."
BernieSanders,"If we are serious about having the best-educated workforce in the world, we have got to make public colleges and universities tuition-free."
BernieSanders,It is unconscionable that millions of people in the world’s richest country are one diagnosis or car accident away from financial disaster.
BernieSanders,"We will lose our fights for justice when we are divided or apathetic, and the fights coming this year are far too important to risk that."
BernieSanders,"Congress has got to protect and expand the health care needs of working families, not cut them."
BernieSanders,Stopping the Republican assault on the working class will require the active participation of millions of Americans in every community.
BernieSanders,The struggle for our rights is not a one-time event. It must be fought by every generation.
BernieSanders,"We won’t let Republicans punish the elderly, children, sick and poor while they reward their billionaire friends. https://t.co/aBgGnSd3ao"
BernieSanders,We've seen the surefire route to success in politics has been to manipulate people's fear and ignorance. We can and will change that.
BernieSanders,We are living in a nation which worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don't think that is the nation we should be living in.

BernieSanders,Fossil fuel companies are willing to destroy the planet for short-term profits. That is just incomprehensible. Incomprehensible.
BernieSanders,The pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable industry in the country. That should not be the case when people’s lives are at stake.
BernieSanders,Republicans claim to represent family values but plan to throw 30 million people off health insurance. That doesn't seem like family values.
BernieSanders,Cities and towns and states have stepped up and raised the minimum wage to $15. It’s about time that Congress does the same for all workers.
BernieSanders,You cannot be a party which takes money from Wall Street and then tells working families you are on their side. People see through that.
BernieSanders,The U.S. shouldn’t discourage kids who want to go to college with massive costs. We should be educating as many people as we possibly can.
BernieSanders,"Our goal must be to improve the VA, not destroy it. We will vigorously oppose any and all efforts to privatize the VA."

BernieSanders,I wish elected officials would spend less time making it harder for people to vote and more time fighting for the working class.
BernieSanders,Members of Congress spend way too much time in pursuit of money and too little time actually debating the issues.
BernieSanders,"Here's a radical idea.  Let's create an economy that works for the bottom 99%, not just the people on top."
BernieSanders,My nightmare is our grandchildren wondering why we did not leave them a planet that is habitable.
BernieSanders,25 states and cities raised minimum wages this year. How is that possible? Because millions of people stood up to fight.

BernieSanders,"The EPA needs a leader who will actually protect the environment, not a climate denier like Trump's choice Scott Pruitt."
BernieSanders,"We have accomplished too much as a country to see our progress washed away by leaders who are fearful, hateful and misinformed."
BernieSanders,"It really is frightening when you have a party controlling the House, Senate and presidency and saying ""You know what? We reject science."""
BernieSanders,One of the most revolting aspects of the student loan crisis is that the government makes billions in profits off of student loans.

BernieSanders,It's an international embarrassment that we imprison more people than any other country on earth.
BernieSanders,People should not have to choose between medicine and groceries. And yet the greed of the drug industry makes that happen every day.
BernieSanders,People who want to limit carbon emissions: ✅ Majority of Democrats ✅ Majority of Republicans ❌ Trump's choice for EPA head

BernieSanders,"Trump's cabinet, the wealthiest in history, is worth more than the annual GDP of 70 countries. So much for draining the swamp..."
BernieSanders,Mr. Trump and his friends should know there are millions of people who will not stand for their greed at the expense of the working class.
BernieSanders,"While tens of millions of children around the world go hungry and uneducated, a handful of billionaires divide up the riches of the planet."

BernieSanders,"We must stand with our brothers and sisters in NC who despite the GOP power grab are bravely fighting for economic, racial &amp  social justice."
BernieSanders,"My parents' dream was that if they worked hard as parents, they'd see their kids go to college. We must keep that promise to every family."

BernieSanders,Are we comfortable to see a huge increase in millionaires and billionaires but have more people living in poverty than ever? I know I'm not.
BernieSanders,The ruling class likes to believe this country belongs to them. There are millions of us who would say otherwise.
BernieSanders,"We must stop the movement toward oligarchy and fight for an economy which works for all, not just the 1%. https://t.co/mu1PwrpBPS"

BernieSanders,"We are rapidly moving toward a nation of the super-rich, by the super-rich and for the super-rich."

BernieSanders,Garnishing social security benefits to pay off student debt is a clear example of why we need fundamental changes in our national priorities
BernieSanders,It is beyond absurd that so many bright young people are unable to attend college because of the cost.
BernieSanders,"We are moving toward an oligarchic form of society, and it will take all of us to fight against it."
BernieSanders,"Clinton received almost 3 million more votes, but Trump will be the next president. It's clear the electoral college needs to be changed."
BernieSanders,"Lowering prices on prescription drugs—that is, making sure that people can afford to live—should not be a partisan issue."
BernieSanders,Every person in this country deserves a decent opportunity and a decent standard of living. Until that happens we will not truly be free.
BernieSanders,It would be nice to put off worrying about climate change for a few decades. But the truth is we have no choice but to act now.
BernieSanders,We are living in a nation which worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don't think that is the nation we should be living in.
BernieSanders,The wealthy have seen their incomes rise immensely in the last 30 years. It is not class warfare to say they don't need another tax break.
BernieSanders,Money and wealth should serve the people. The people should not have to serve money and wealth.
BernieSanders,There is something profoundly wrong when one family owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans.
BernieSanders,Cuts to life and death programs like Medicare and massive tax breaks for the wealthy—that's not what America is supposed to be about.
BernieSanders,"Even though the same proportion of blacks and whites use marijuana, a black person is almost 4x more likely to be arrested for possession."
BernieSanders,Walmart costs taxpayers $6.2 billion every year in public assistance programs by not paying their workers a living wage. That is insane.
BernieSanders,Congress must begin listening to the majority of Americans who do not want cuts to Medicaid and Medicare.
BernieSanders,"Our job is to grow the union movement so that anyone working 40 hours a week, whether it’s in a factory or a hotel, doesn't live in poverty."
BernieSanders,A small subsection of the one percent are hell-bent on doing everything in their power to block action against climate change.
BernieSanders,"Young people in this country should be in good schools and at good jobs, not in jail cells."
BernieSanders,There is hatred being generated against immigrants in this country. We've got to stand together and reject that hate.

BernieSanders,"This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. Our job: abolish poverty, not let 130,000 people die every year because of it."
BernieSanders,Men in the wealthiest counties in this country live 18 years longer than men in the poorest counties.
BernieSanders,Poverty in America is a death sentence. Wealthy women live 12 years longer than lower income women.

BernieSanders,"We must end the ""war on drugs,"" which has destroyed lives and disproportionately impacted people of color."
BernieSanders,"Instead of frightening 11 million undocumented people with deportation, we need comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship."
BernieSanders,We must end private prisons and detention centers in the U.S. The time is long overdue for real criminal justice reform.

BernieSanders,"I don’t know how many times I have to say it, but I’ll keep saying it until it happens: all people should have a right to health care."
BernieSanders,"Maybe, just maybe, we want to pass legislation to make the wealthy start paying their fair share in taxes before we start slashing Medicare."
BernieSanders,Does @realDonaldTrump have the guts to stand up to House Republicans who want to slash Social Security?
BernieSanders,"Millions of seniors, disabled vets and people with disabilities can't get by on $11,000 or less. We must expand Social Security, not cut it."
BernieSanders,Donald Trump is a pathological liar.  We need the help of the American people to build a movement of millions who are following reality.
BernieSanders,"Everyone who voted for Trump, who thought he'd defend working people, pay attention to the reality of what he's doing not just his rhetoric."

BernieSanders,Trump attacked Wall Street on the campaign. Now he nominates a former Goldman Sachs executive to be Treasury secretary. What hypocrisy!
BernieSanders,America remains the only major country not to guarantee health care for all. The Republican response: throw millions off health insurance.
BernieSanders,Trump's focus should not be a few people who might burn the American flag. It should be on working families and combatting climate change.
BernieSanders,"If Trump is serious about helping the middle class, we’ll work with him. So far, it’s clear he doesn’t give a damn about working families."
BernieSanders,"Donald Trump wants to treat corporate greed with kid gloves. If he won’t stand up for America’s working class, we must."

BernieSanders,.@realDonaldTrump's plan to eliminate the estate tax wouldn't help working families. It's a $4 billion tax break for his own family.
BernieSanders,A progressive estate tax on the wealthiest 0.2% of Americans is the fairest way to reduce wealth inequality and invest in working families.
BernieSanders,.@HillaryClinton understands we need a tax system which asks billionaires to pay their fair share &amp  reduces the obscene level of inequality.
BernieSanders,.@realDonaldTrump’s solution to massive inequality is to provide a tax break worth $353 billion to the top 0.2% by ending the estate tax.

BernieSanders,"When your friends say they won't vote, ask how much student debt they have. There's only one candidate who will make college affordable."
BernieSanders,When we talk about public education it's no longer good enough to talk about 1st-12th grade. We must talk about making college tuition free.
BernieSanders,"In the year 2016, we cannot accept bigotry as the cornerstone of any campaign for president of the United States."
BernieSanders,"Donald Trump was a leader in the ""Birther Movement,"" which tried to delegitimize President Obama. That is nothing less than racism."

BernieSanders,It is time to take marijuana off the federal list of controlled substances and let states decide. Sign if you agree: https://t.co/6BlaUnQgTU

BernieSanders,"People should be rewarded for getting an education, not punished with student debt of $50,000, $100,000 or more."
BernieSanders,Right now we have a fundamentally corrupt energy policy. It is rigged to boost the profits of big oil at the expense of average Americans.
BernieSanders,I want to move to public funding of elections so anyone can run for office without having to beg for money from the wealthy and powerful.

BernieSanders,"That's just a ""single issue"" where @HillaryClinton and I differ."
BernieSanders,"In my view, we need to repeal the 1996 welfare reform provisions and expand, not weaken, the social safety net."
BernieSanders,"In 2008, @HillaryClinton said that “welfare should not be an anti-poverty program.” I disagree."
BernieSanders,This legislation has weakened the social safety net and increased extreme poverty. That is unacceptable.
BernieSanders,This legislation gave Republican governors like Scott Walker the responsibility to provide a safety net for families in need.
BernieSanders,"In 1994, welfare provided a vital safety net to more than 14 million Americans. Today, it only helps 4.4 million."

BernieSanders,The number of children in extreme poverty has skyrocketed from 1.4 million to 3.5 million.
BernieSanders,It established strict work requirements for receiving benefits and severely limited access to benefits for undocumented people.
BernieSanders,"Since this legislation was signed into law, families living in extreme poverty have more than doubled from 636,000 to 1.65 million."
BernieSanders,It turns out that the welfare reform bill has been an absolute disaster.
BernieSanders,"Unfortunately, @HillaryClinton supported this bill calling it “a critical first step to reforming our nation’s welfare system.”"
BernieSanders,"I called that bill “an assault on the poor, women and children, minorities, and immigrants.” I believed that then and I believe that now."
BernieSanders,One of the biggest differences between the Clintons and myself in this campaign is our view on welfare reform. https://t.co/kuBG52HAhj
BernieSanders,It wasn't Governor Cuomo who had the idea to raise the minimum wage. It was the people telling him what to do. That's how change happens.

BernieSanders,"As president, I will proudly stand with working families and fight for a $15 an hour federal minimum wage. https://t.co/TrJNAdX0nI"
BernieSanders,"Not too long ago, they told us that a $15 min wage was unrealistic. Some said it was ‘pie-in-the-sky.’ NY and CA are just the tipping point."
BernieSanders,"Today, the Supreme Court helped ensure the equality of one person, one vote. Now, we must continue to fight all forms of voter suppression."

BernieSanders,A strong and growing trade-union movement not only protects its own members but drives up wages for all Americans.
BernieSanders,"As president, I will increase funding for education and demand that profitable corporations start paying their fair share of taxes."
BernieSanders,Walker has provided huge tax breaks for corporations while making the largest cuts to education in Wisconsin history. He's got it backwards.
BernieSanders,"I say to Scott Walker: if you are afraid of fair and open elections, get out of politics and get another job."
BernieSanders,"Under Gov. Walker, we are seeing massive efforts to make it harder for people to vote in Wisconsin. Absolutely wrong and unacceptable."
BernieSanders,"In 1980, Congress required credit unions to cap interest rates at 15 percent. It's time to extend this cap to every lender in America."
